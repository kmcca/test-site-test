More information is available in the [endpoint release history](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_ism_endpoint_history).\\n\\n### Auto-Login Enhancements\\n\\n- Veracode Dynamic Analysis has streamlined authentication configuration with an enhanced auto-login capability. You should use auto-login to provide a username and password for auto-login, browser-generated logins, and NTLMv2. Auto-login is the default setting. A separate, basic authentication section is available to configure authentication for websites that require two forms of authentication: auto-login and browser-generated authentication. Veracode continues to support Selenium-based login scripts with these changes.\\n\\n### Coverage Improvements\\n\\n- The latest release of Veracode Dynamic Analysis includes new generic injection techniques in the scan engine and flaw publishing process.

Veracode will apply the update upon rescan of the application.\\n\\n### Improved Notifications for Delayed Scan Results\\n\\n- Veracode has improved communication about delayed scan results. You now receive email notifications that include additional details and links for the affected scan. Veracode has also improved the Veracode Platform to indicate delayed scans that are under investigation.\\n\\n## October 19, 2020\\n\\n### Applications REST API\\n\\n- You can now view application data and create, update, and delete applications using the Veracode Applications REST API.\\n\\n## September 30, 2020\\n\\n### Updates to Required Veracode Domains\\n\\n- [Veracode has introduced two URLs to which you must allow access](https://docs.veracode.com/r/IP_addresses). If you restrict access to public internet sites for your organization, add app.pendo.io and analytics2.veracode.com to your allowlist.\\n\\n## September 26, 2020\\n\\n### Rolling Sandbox Histories\\n\\n- Rolling sandbox histories let you limit sandbox data by restricting the number of retained scans for each sandbox to 15. After more than 15 scans, the Veracode Platform deletes the oldest scan, though the data remains available through Veracode Analytics. If enabled, this feature replaces the previous data limitation method of expiring old sandboxes.\\n\\n- To request access to rolling sandbox histories, contact Veracode Technical Support.\\n\\n### Updates to Some XML API Deletion Calls\\n\\n- To improve performance, the `deleteuser.do`, `deleteteam.do`, `deleteapp.do`, and `removefiles.do` XML API calls now return an HTTP 200 response and a change summary, instead of a list of the items remaining after the deletion.\\n\\n### Shareable Links to Your Analytics Dashboards\\n\\n- You can now share links to Veracode Analytics dashboards, including Veracode dashboards and dashboards that your organization creates. To access a dashboard link, you must log in to the Veracode Platform and have permission to view the data in the dashboard.\\n\\n### Activity Log Updates\\n\\n- You can now download a report of the full history of application profile activity, scan activity, and sandbox activity. The activity log in the Veracode Platform now displays activity data for the past 90 days.\\n\\n### Technique Removed from TSRV Format for Accepting Risk\\n\\n- Veracode has removed Technique from the TSRV standard when you perform the Accept the Risk mitigation action because none of the techniques are relevant to accepting risk. Specifics, Remaining Risk, and Verification are still required fields.\\n\\n### Updates to CWE Top 25 Policy Rules\\n\\n- The Latest CWE Top 25 policy rule in the Veracode Platform now reflects the 2020 CWE Top 25 standard. Veracode has also updated the 2019 CWE Top 25 policy rule to disallow the children of CWE-94: CWE-91, 95, 98, 185, and 830.\\n\\n## September 17, 2020\\n\\n### Improved Business Units Tab\\n\\n- On the Administration page in the Veracode Platform, Veracode has improved the usability of the **Business Units** tab.\\n\\n## September 10, 2020\\n\\n### New Video - Create and Manage API Users in the Veracode Platform\\n\\n- [This video shows you how to configure an API service account in the Veracode Platform](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_video_create_and_manage_api_users).\\n\\n## August 29, 2020\\n\\n### All Applications Page Now Available to Mitigation Approver and Delete Scans Roles\\n\\n- You can now access the All Applications page in the Veracode Platform with the Mitigation Approver or Delete Scans roles.

CWE-74, which Veracode discovers during Dynamic Analysis, is now included on the disallowed CWE IDs list in the latest version of the OWASP security standard. If your organization is using the OWASP 2017 security standard, you may see more findings violating policy or see your application fail policy as a result of this change.\\n\\n### Support for MITRE CWE List Version 4.1\\n\\n- Veracode now provides reporting based on CWE version 4.1 definitions, which changes the names and descriptions of a few existing CWE categories. The complete list of changes in CWE version 4.1 is available from the MITRE website. This new version does not impact the CWE mappings for the OWASP, CWE Top 25, or CERT security standards.\\n\\n- MITRE is updating their CWE list on a more frequent basis, but Veracode remains committed to staying up-to-date with each new version. As MITRE updates their CWE database, you might notice periodic changes in Veracode reports, such as differences between parent-child relationships or mappings.\\n\\n## August 21, 2020\\n\\n### Findings API Version 2\\n\\n- The Veracode Findings REST API v2 is now available.
